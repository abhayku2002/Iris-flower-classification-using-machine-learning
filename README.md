Machine learning is almost everywhere nowadays. Itâ€™s become more and more necessary day by day. From the recommendation of what to buy to recognizing a person, robotics, everywhere is machine learning. 

ABSTRACT <br>
The project scope entails employing diverse machine learning algorithms on the Iris dataset to classify iris flower species. <br/>
With 200 instances categorized into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica classes, the study includes model training, evaluation, and comparative analysis to discern the most effective algorithms, offering insights for botany and related fields. <br/> <br/>
The scope encompasses the following key elements: 
Dataset Analysis: Utilizing the Iris dataset containing 200 instances of iris flowers, each categorized into one of three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset includes features such as petal and sepal measurements
Model Training and Evaluation: Segmentation of the dataset into training and testing subsets, followed by the training of machine learning models on the training data. <br/>
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall on the testing data.<br/> <br/>
Comparative Analysis: Conducting a comparative analysis of the performance of different machine learning algorithms in iris flower classification. 
This involves identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in accurately categorizing iris flower species.<br/>
